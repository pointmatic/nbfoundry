> Recipe-driven data preparation and caching for machine learning.

DataRefinery compiles a single YAML **recipe** into a materialized
**instance**: the recipe, the prepared dataset, the fitted statistics
produced during preparation, and a report describing both. Re-running an
unchanged recipe over unchanged inputs returns the cached instance
unchanged; any semantic edit invalidates and rebuilds.

The first-class category is **image classification**; tabular and text
plugin stubs exist to keep the abstractions honest. See the
[concept](docs/specs/concept.md), [features](docs/specs/features.md),
and [tech-spec](docs/specs/tech-spec.md) documents for design depth.

## Why DataRefinery

Data prep for ML training usually lives in throwaway notebooks: steps
decay between projects, train/inference skew creeps in, splits leak,
and reproducibility relies on muscle memory. DataRefinery replaces that
with one declarative artifact (the recipe) and a deterministic
materialization path. Highlights:

- **Reproducibility contract.** Same recipe + same inputs + same seed
  produces a byte-identical instance. Every stochastic operation is
  seeded; fitted statistics from the training split are persisted so
  inference replays the exact transformations.
- **Semantic cache identity.** Cache addressing combines a canonical
  hash of the recipe (whitespace- and key-order-insensitive) with a
  hash of the raw inputs and the seed. Cosmetic edits don't rebuild;
  meaningful edits do.
- **Atomic temp-then-promote.** Materialization writes into a temp
  directory and promotes only after success — partial instances never
  appear in the cache.
- **Recipe is authoritative.** The recipe is the single source of
  truth for pipeline semantics. CLI flags and env vars only control
  execution context (cache root, log level, workers, plugin path).
  The one sanctioned override is `--seed` for ad-hoc runs.
- **Library + CLI as co-equal surfaces.** Same recipe, same operations,
  no second code path to drift from at serving time.

## Installation

DataRefinery requires Python 3.12.

```bash
pip install ml-datarefinery
```

The PyPI distribution name is `ml-datarefinery`; the Python import name
and console script remain `datarefinery` (e.g. `import datarefinery` and
`datarefinery --help`). Same shape as `scikit-learn` / `import sklearn`.

For the optional LLM-enhancement layer (FR-17), install with the
`[llm]` extra:

```bash
pip install 'ml-datarefinery[llm]'
```

For the robustness-evaluation `imagecorruptions_apply` Generation op
(FR-GEN-1), which applies Hendrycks-Dietterich (ICLR 2019) image
corruptions, install with the `[corruptions]` extra:

```bash
pip install 'ml-datarefinery[corruptions]'
```

### From source (development)

DataRefinery uses [`pyve`](https://pointmatic.github.io/pyve/) to
manage two isolated environments: one for the runtime package and one
for dev tooling (ruff, mypy, pytest).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pointmatic/datarefinery.git
cd datarefinery

# Runtime env
pyve init
pyve run pip install -e /path/to/datarefinery

# Dev tooling env (one-time)
pyve testenv init
pyve testenv install -r requirements-dev.txt
pyve testenv run pip install -e /path/to/datarefinery

# Run the test suite
pyve test
```

## Quickstart

DataRefinery's documented user journey is `init → validate →
materialize → status`. The example below uses an
`image_classification` layout: a directory of class-named
subdirectories, each holding image files.

```text
my-images/
  cat/
    cat_001.png
    cat_002.png
    ...
  dog/
    dog_001.png
    ...
```

```bash
# 1. Scaffold a starter recipe from raw images (deterministic, offline).
datarefinery init --input my-images --output recipe.yaml

# 2. (Optional) Review the recipe and uncomment any suggested
#    Transformations (e.g. resize, normalize).

# 3. Validate the recipe against the schema and FR-2 static checks.
datarefinery validate recipe.yaml

# 4. Materialize the pipeline end-to-end. The first run is a cache
#    miss; the cached instance is promoted atomically on success.
datarefinery --cache-root ./cache materialize recipe.yaml

# 5. Inspect the instance summary (cache hit on a re-run).
datarefinery --cache-root ./cache status recipe.yaml
```

After a successful `materialize`, the cache layout looks like:

```text
cache/instances/<recipe-hash>/<input-hash>/<seed>/
├── recipe.yaml              # exact recipe used (canonicalized for the cache key)
├── manifest.json            # full hashes, record counts, schema version
├── dataset/                 # prepared dataset (e.g. <split>.jsonl)
├── fitted_statistics/       # statistics fitted on the training split
└── report/
    ├── report.md            # human-readable summary
    ├── drift.json           # stable contract for downstream drift tooling
    └── visualizations/      # PNGs declared in the recipe
```

The `<recipe-hash>` and `<input-hash>` directory names use the first
16 hex characters of each SHA-256; the full hashes are recorded in
`manifest.json`.

### Alternative layout: flat directory + sidecar labels

If your dataset is a flat directory of images plus a separate manifest
of labels (the common third-party shape — Kaggle CSVs, re-labeled
datasets, etc.), declare the source as `image_flat` and point its
`label_from` at the manifest:

```text
my-dataset/
  images/
    img_001.png
    img_002.png
    ...
  labels.csv         # filename,class
```

```yaml
Input:
  sources:
    - name: images
      type: image_flat
      path: ./my-dataset/images
      label_from:
        path: ./my-dataset/labels.csv
        join: by_id
        id_field: filename
        label_field: class
Labels:
  field: label
  source: { kind: direct }
```

The loader joins each image's filename stem against the manifest's
`filename` column and writes the matching `class` value into the
record's `label` field at load time. `validate` enforces the join
(check 19): missing ids, duplicate ids, and column-name typos are
caught before `materialize` runs. See `docs/guides/recipe-authoring.md`
for headerless manifests and `by_row_order` (CIFAR-style) variants.

### Pre-partitioned sources (Kaggle-style train/test)

Most third-party datasets ship pre-partitioned: a `train/` directory
authored by the publisher and a `test/` directory intended to remain
heldout from training. Declare each source's role with `partition`:

```text
my-dataset/
  train/cat/, train/dog/, …            # ImageFolder layout per partition
  test/cat/,  test/dog/,  …
```

```yaml
Input:
  sources:
    - name: train_data
      type: image_folder
      path: ./my-dataset/train
      partition: train
    - name: test_data
      type: image_folder
      path: ./my-dataset/test
      partition: test
Splits:
  ratios: { train: 0.85, val: 0.15 }
  applies_to: train                     # carve val from train; test stays heldout
  stratify_by: label
  seed: 7
```

The materialized instance contains three splits: `train` and `val`
(sub-partitioned from the source's `train` directory) and `test`
(passed through verbatim from the source's `test` directory). Omitting
`Splits` (or writing `Splits: {}`) honors the source partitions as the
final splits without sub-partitioning. Validator check 20 enforces
consistency — every record's partition declaration is honored end-to-end.

### Unlabeled partitions (Kaggle-style test set with no labels)

The classic Kaggle shape ships a labeled training set together with an
unlabeled heldout test partition. Declare the unlabeled source with
`type: image_flat` (the heldout side has no class subdirectories) and
`unlabeled: true`:

```yaml
Input:
  sources:
    - name: train_data
      type: image_folder
      path: ./my-dataset/train
      partition: train
    - name: test_data
      type: image_flat                  # flat layout, no labels
      path: ./my-dataset/test
      partition: test
      unlabeled: true
Labels:
  field: label
  source: { kind: direct }              # labels exist for labeled partitions
Splits:
  ratios: { train: 0.85, val: 0.15 }
  applies_to: train                     # only sub-partition the labeled side
  stratify_by: label
```

Records loaded from `test_data` land without a `label` field. They
flow through label-independent stages (resize, normalize) normally;
label-dependent stages (`stratify_by` on an unlabeled partition,
`filter_by_label`, label-reading featurizations) are rejected at
validate time (check 21). `report.md` flags the unlabeled split with
`*(unlabeled)*`; `drift.json` reports `class_distribution: null` with
a `"skipped: unlabeled"` note. The materialized `dataset/test.jsonl`
is ready for downstream inference — train a model on `train`+`val`,
predict against `test`, and submit. (Inference itself is external to
DataRefinery.)

## Recipe anatomy

A recipe is a single YAML file. Field names match the section set
used by the validator and runner; each operation declares the stages
and splits it applies to so train-only behavior is explicit.

```yaml
schema_version: 1
plugin: image_classification
seed: 0

Input:
  sources:
    - name: train
      type: image_folder
      path: my-images

Output:
  record_schema:
    image: { dtype: uint8, shape: [32, 32, 3] }
    label: { dtype: str }
    path:  { dtype: str }

Labels:
  field: label
  source: { kind: derived, derivation: parent_directory_name }

Splits:
  ratios: { train: 0.7, val: 0.15, test: 0.15 }
  seed: 11
  stratify_by: label

Transformations:
  - name: resize
    op: resize
    params: { size: 32, method: bilinear }
    splits: [train, val, test]
  - name: normalize
    op: normalize
    fit_source: train          # statistics fit on train, applied everywhere
    splits: [train, val, test]

Featurizations:
  - name: derive_label
    inputs: [path]
    output_field: label
    op: label_from_path
    params: { source: parent_directory_name }
    splits: [train, val, test]

Visualizations:
  - name: class_distribution
    op: class_distribution_histogram
    stage: post_pipeline
    mode: reporting
  - name: samples
    op: sample_grid
    params: { n: 16, per_class: true }
    stage: post_pipeline
    mode: reporting

variants:
  no_augment:
    Augmentations: []
```

Section roles at a glance:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `Input` | Declared raw sources (files, directories, parquet, etc.) |
| `Output` | Record schema the materialized dataset must satisfy |
| `Labels` | Where labels come from (column, derivation, sidecar) |
| `SampleData` | A small inlined sample for documentation/testing |
| `InputContracts` | Pre-pipeline assertions on raw input shape/values |
| `Filters` | Row-removal policy (e.g. class-imbalance via subsetting) |
| `Generation` | Synthetic record generation |
| `Splits` | Train/val/test ratios, stratification, seed |
| `Transformations` | Deterministic ops; `fit_source: train` persists stats |
| `Augmentations` | Stochastic, train-only by default |
| `Featurizations` | Derive new fields from existing ones |
| `OutputExpectations` | Post-pipeline assertions on materialized data |
| `Visualizations` | Exploration (on-demand) or reporting (persisted) views |
| `variants` | Named overlays on any section (experiment knobs) |

Select a variant at materialize time with `--variant no_augment`.
Variants change the canonical hash (and therefore the cache identity).

For a section-by-section walk-through — including fit-on-train
discipline, variants, contracts/expectations, and the Filters-vs-Splits
choice for class imbalance — see the
[Recipe authoring guide](docs/guides/recipe-authoring.md).

## Plugin model

A **plugin** contributes the operations that make sense for one data
category. Plugins register through the `datarefinery.plugins`
entry-point group and are discovered automatically.

v1 ships:

- `image_classification` — first-class, full operation set (resize,
  normalize, class-distribution and sample-grid visualizations,
  label-from-path featurization, etc.).
- `tabular` — stub plugin exercising the abstractions; no working ops.
- `text` — stub plugin exercising the abstractions; no working ops.

A plugin declares, for each operation, an `OperationSpec` covering
parameter schema, `fit_on_train` flag, applicable splits, and
applicable recipe sections. The validator cross-checks recipe
operations against these specs (FR-2 check 18). See
[`src/datarefinery/plugins/base.py`](src/datarefinery/plugins/base.py)
for the protocol, and the [plugin authoring guide](docs/guides/plugin-authoring.md)
for a walk-through of writing your own.

## Library API

Library and CLI are co-equal surfaces driven by the same recipe.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from datarefinery import DataRefinery, materialize
from datarefinery.core.config import RuntimeConfig

config = RuntimeConfig(cache_root=Path("./cache"))

# High-level: one-shot materialize a recipe path.
instance = materialize("recipe.yaml", config=config)
print(instance.manifest.record_counts)

# Lower-level: load once, then call verbs against the loaded recipe.
dr = DataRefinery.from_recipe("recipe.yaml", config=config)
report = dr.validate()
instance = dr.materialize()
```

## v1 scope and non-goals

**In scope for v1:**

- Recipe-driven pipeline with the section set above; explicit
  per-operation stage/split applicability.
- Schema-versioned YAML recipes; load-time refusal of unknown
  versions; documented migration path between versions.
- Materialized instance = recipe + dataset + fitted statistics +
  report. No statistical artifacts persisted outside the report.
- Semantic cache identity (canonical recipe hash ⊕ raw-input hash ⊕
  seed). Whitespace/key-order edits do not trigger rebuilds.
- Atomic temp-then-promote materialization; no partial instances in
  cache.
- Named variants within a recipe; experiment knobs are variants, not
  separate recipes.
- Image plugin scoped to **classification**; tabular and text stubs.
- Deterministic `init` scaffolder; optional LLM enhancement layer via
  `lmentry` as an extra.
- Stable drift-relevant report subsection for downstream tooling.

**Non-goals for v1:**

- Image tasks beyond classification (detection, segmentation).
- Model framework abstraction, training, evaluation, inference.
- Production streaming and drift-detection logic.
- Persisted statistical artifacts beyond the report (no sidecar
  pickles, no separate stats files).
- Recipe inheritance or multi-file recipe composition (variants
  suffice).
- Resume-from-stage during materialization.
- Hard LLM dependency (DataRefinery must work fully offline).
- Tabular and text plugin implementations (stubs only).
- Hard performance targets (reactive performance work only).
- `init` for non-image categories.
