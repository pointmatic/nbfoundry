# Project-Guide — Calm the chaos of LLM-assisted coding

This document provides step-by-step instructions for an LLM to assist a human developer in a project. 

## How to Use Project-Guide

### For Developers
After installing project-guide (`pip install project-guide`) and running `project-guide init`, instruct your LLM as follows in the chat interface: 

```
Read `docs/project-guide/go.md`
```

After reading, the LLM will respond:
1. (optional) "I need more information..." followed by a list of questions or details needed. 
  - LLM will continue asking until all needed information is clear.
2. "The next step is ___."
3. "Say 'go' when you're ready." 

For efficiency, when you change modes, start a new LLM conversation. 

### For LLMs

**Modes**
This Project-Guide offers a human-in-the-loop workflow for you to follow that can be dynamically reconfigured based on the project `mode`. Each `mode` defines a focused cycle of steps to guide you (the LLM) to help generate artifacts for some facet in the project lifecycle. This document is customized for code_direct.

**Approval Gate**
When you have completed the steps, pause for the developer to review, correct, redirect, or ask questions about your work.  

**Rules**
- Work through each step methodically, presenting your work for approval before continuing a cycle. 
- When the developer says "go" (or equivalent like "continue", "next", "proceed"), continue with the next action. 
- If the next action is unclear, tell the developer you don't have a clear direction on what to do next, then suggest something. 
- Never auto-advance past an approval gate—always wait for explicit confirmation. 
- At approval gates, present the completed work and wait. Do **not** propose follow-up actions outside the current mode step — in particular, do not prompt for git operations (commits, pushes, PRs, branch creation), CI runs, or deploys unless the current step explicitly calls for them. The developer initiates these on their own schedule.
- After compacting memory, re-read this guide to refresh your context.
- Before recording a new memory, reflect: is this fact project-specific (belongs in `docs/specs/project-essentials.md`) or cross-project (belongs in LLM memory)? Could it belong in both? If project-specific, add it to `project-essentials.md` instead of or in addition to memory.
- When creating any new source file, add a copyright notice and license header using the comment syntax for that file type (`#` for Python/YAML/shell, `//` for JS/TS, `<!-- -->` for HTML/Svelte). Check this project's `project-essentials.md` for the specific copyright holder, license, and SPDX identifier to use.
- **Bundled artifact templates** live at `docs/project-guide/templates/artifacts/` in this project (installed by `project-guide init`, refreshed by `project-guide update`). When a mode step references an artifact template by name (e.g. `concept.md`, `stories.md`, `project-essentials.md`), that is the directory to read from — do not search the filesystem, the Python install location, or `site-packages`.

## Project Essentials

<!--
This file captures must-know facts future LLMs need to avoid blunders when
working on this project. It is injected verbatim under a `## Project
Essentials` section in every rendered `go.md`, so entries here use `###` for
subsections (not `##`). No top-level `#` title — the wrapper provides it.

Pyve-specific rules live in the bundled `pyve-essentials.md` sibling
artifact and render automatically — do NOT duplicate them here.
-->

### File header conventions

Every new source file must begin with a copyright notice and license
identifier. Use the comment syntax for the file type:

| File type | Comment syntax |
|-----------|---------------|
| Python, YAML, shell, Makefile | `#` |
| JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, C/C++ | `//` or `/* */` |
| HTML, Svelte, XML | `<!-- -->` |
| CSS, SCSS | `/* */` |

**This project's header:**

- **Copyright**: `Copyright (c) 2026 Pointmatic`
- **SPDX identifier**: `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`

Python example:
```python
# Copyright (c) 2026 Pointmatic
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

TypeScript example:
```typescript
// Copyright (c) 2026 Pointmatic
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

HTML example:
```html
<!-- Copyright (c) 2026 Pointmatic -->
<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 -->
```

**Compiler exception (FR-8 step 3):** the `nbfoundry` compiler does **not**
inject headers into author-authored notebooks it processes. If an author
has stripped the header from their own notebook, that's their choice —
preserve it as-is rather than re-injecting. This applies only to
hand-authored notebook source consumed by `nbfoundry compile` /
`compile_exercise`; it does **not** apply to files **you** create as part
of this project's source tree, which always carry the header.



### Pyve Essentials

#### Workflow rules — pyve environment conventions

This project uses `pyve` with **two separate environments**. Picking the wrong invocation form often "works" but leads to subtle drift. Use the canonical forms below:

- **Runtime code (the package itself):** `pyve run python ...` or `pyve run <entry-point> ...`.
- **Tests:** `pyve test [pytest args]` — **not** `pyve run pytest`. Pytest is not installed in the main `.venv/`; it lives in the dev testenv at `.pyve/testenv/venv/`.
- **Dev tools (ruff, mypy, pytest):** `pyve testenv run ruff check ...`, `pyve testenv run mypy ...`.
- **Initialize the testenv (one-time):** `pyve testenv init` creates `.pyve/testenv/venv/`. Required before `pyve testenv install` or `pyve testenv run` will work — those subcommands do not auto-create the env. See [pyve `testenv` subcommand reference](https://pointmatic.github.io/pyve/usage/#testenv-subcommand).
- **Install dev tools:** `pyve testenv install -r requirements-dev.txt` (after `pyve testenv init`). **Do not** run `pip install -e ".[dev]"` into the main venv — that pollutes the runtime environment with test-only dependencies and breaks the two-env isolation.

If `pytest` fails with "not found" that is the signal to use `pyve test`, not to `pip install pytest` into the wrong venv. If `pyve testenv install` or `pyve testenv run` fails complaining the env doesn't exist, run `pyve testenv init` first.

#### LLM-internal vs. developer-facing invocation

`pyve run` is for the LLM's own Bash-tool invocations; developer-facing command suggestions use the bare form verbatim from the mode template.

- ✅ Developer-facing: `project-guide mode plan_phase`
- ❌ Developer-facing: `pyve run project-guide mode plan_phase`
- ✅ LLM Bash-tool: `pyve run project-guide mode plan_phase`

**Why:** the LLM's Bash-tool shell does not auto-activate `.venv/`, so the LLM must wrap its own commands with `pyve run`. The developer's shell is typically already pyve/direnv-activated, so the bare form resolves correctly and matches the commands quoted throughout mode templates and documentation.

**How to apply:** never prepend environment wrappers (`pyve run`, `poetry run`, `uv run`, etc.) to commands you quote back to the developer from a mode template. Use the wrapper only when you execute the command yourself through the Bash tool.

#### Python invocation rule

Always use `python`, never `python3`. The `python3` command bypasses `asdf` version shims and may resolve to the system interpreter rather than the project-pinned version, leading to subtle version mismatches.

#### `requirements-dev.txt` story-writing rule

Any story that introduces dev tooling (ruff, mypy, pytest, types-* stubs) **must** include a task to create or update `requirements-dev.txt` so that `pyve testenv init && pyve testenv install -r requirements-dev.txt` reproduces the full dev environment in two commands. This keeps the dev environment reproducible and prevents "it works on my machine" drift.

#### Editable install and testenv dependency management

LLMs often get confused about *where* to install an editable package when using pyve's two-environment model. The wrong choice "works" but creates subtle drift.

**Main environment only (preferred for library projects):**
```bash
pyve run pip install -e .
```
Then configure pytest to find the source tree without a second editable install:
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
pythonpath = ["."]   # or ["src"] for src layout
```
`pythonpath` handles import discovery cleanly and avoids maintaining two editable installs with potentially diverging dependency resolution.

**Testenv editable install (required for CLI projects):**
```bash
pyve testenv init                                # one-time, creates .pyve/testenv/venv/
pyve testenv run pip install -e .
pyve testenv install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
Use this when tests invoke CLI entry points (console scripts), because `pythonpath` only handles imports — it does not register entry points.

**Rule of thumb:** use `pythonpath` for library/package projects; use editable install in testenv for projects whose tests exercise CLI entry points.

**Important:** When `pyve` purges and reinitialises the main environment, the testenv remains intact and the testenv editable install survives. Re-running `pyve run pip install -e .` restores the main-environment editable install. See `developer/python-editable-install.md` for the full decision guide.

# code_direct mode (cycle)

> Generate code directly, test after


Implement stories rapidly with direct commits to main. Focus on feature completion and iteration speed over process overhead.

**Next Action**
Restart the cycle of steps. 

---


## Cycle Steps

For each story:

1. **Read** the story's checklist from `docs/specs/stories.md` — always re-fetch from disk with the `Read` tool at the start of each cycle. The developer may have edited the file since you last viewed it (added tasks, reworded scope, marked items done), so do not rely on prior conversation context for its contents.
2. **Implement** all tasks in the checklist
3. **Add copyright/license headers** to every new source file
4. **Run tests** -- `pyve run pytest` (fix failures before continuing)
5. **Run linting** -- fix any issues immediately
6. **Mark tasks** as `[x]` in `stories.md` and change story suffix to `[Done]`
7. **Bump version** in package manifest and source (if the story has a version)
8. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with the version entry
9. **Present** the completed story concisely: what changed (files + line refs), verification results (test counts, lint status), and the suggested next story. Do not propose commits, pushes, or bundling options. Do not offer "want me to also…?" follow-ups.
10. **Wait** for the developer to say "go" before starting the next story

## Velocity Practices

**LLM's role in each cycle:**

- **Version bump per story** -- v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v0.3.0, etc. — bump in package manifest and source
- **Minimal process overhead** -- focus on making it work, not making it perfect
- **Tests run after every story** -- not after every file, but before presenting to developer
- **Fix linting immediately** -- small incremental fixes, not batch cleanup
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** with the version entry before presenting

**Developer's role (do NOT prompt for, offer, or initiate):**

- **Direct commits to main** -- no branches, no PRs, no code review (velocity convention)
- **Commit messages** reference story IDs: `"Story A.a: v0.1.0 Hello World"`
- **Decides when to commit** -- the LLM presents, the developer commits. Multiple stories may be bundled into one commit at the developer's discretion — that is not the LLM's call to make or suggest.

## Story Ordering

- Start with Story A.a (Hello World) if not yet implemented
- If unclear which story is next, ask: "Which story should I work on next?"
- Never skip ahead -- complete stories in order within each phase

## File Header Reminder

Every new source file must include the copyright and license header as the very first content (before code, docstrings, or imports).

## When to Switch Modes

Switch to **code_test_first** when:
- Working on a story with complex logic that benefits from TDD
- The developer requests test-first approach

Switch to **debug** when:
- A bug is discovered during implementation
- Tests are failing unexpectedly

Switch to **production mode** when:
- CI/CD phase is complete and branch protection is enabled
- The project is ready for public users
